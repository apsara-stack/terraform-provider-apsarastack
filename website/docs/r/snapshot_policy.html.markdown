## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `repeat_weekdays` - (Required) The automatic snapshot repetition dates. The unit of measurement is day and the repeating cycle is a week. Value range: [1, 7], which represents days starting from Monday to Sunday, for example 1  indicates Monday. When you want to schedule multiple automatic snapshot tasks for a disk in a week, you can set the RepeatWeekdays to an array.
                                     - A maximum of seven time points can be selected.
                                     - The format is  an JSON array of ["1", "2", … "7"]  and the time points are separated by commas (,).                                                             for example, ["1", "2", ... "7"].
* `retention_days` - (Optional) The snapshot retention time, and the unit of measurement is day. Optional values:
                                    - -1: The automatic snapshots are retained permanently.
                                    - [1, 65536]: The number of days retained.
    
            Default value: -1.
* `time_points` - (Required) The automatic snapshot creation schedule, and the unit of measurement is hour. Value range: [0, 23], which represents from 00:00 to 24:00,  for example 1 indicates 01:00. When you want to schedule multiple automatic snapshot tasks for a disk in a day, you can set the TimePoints to an array.
                                 - A maximum of 24 time points can be selected.
                                 - The format is  an JSON array of ["0", "1", … "23"] and the time points are separated by commas (,).
